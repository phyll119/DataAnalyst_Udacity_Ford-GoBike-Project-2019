##  Profile of Ford GoBike Rentals at Busiest Start Stations


The Ford GoBike System is a regional bike sharing rsystem for the public. It covers the greater San Francisco Bay area in California. The dataset includes information about bike rentals for individual rides taken throughout the system. <br>


This investigation looks at data for all of 2018 with a specific focus on the origination point of rentals. Since the Ford GoBike System data is reported for individual months, a master dataset was created that included January through December data before the exploration began.

## Summary of Findings

My primary interest was to characterize those who use the 5 busiest start_stations and on what days. A secondary interest was learning if the characteristics of the 5 busiest stations and those of the 5 least busiest stations vary.
<p> To better understand the findings: the extreme difference in annual rental numbers should be noted: the ratio beteen 5 busiest and 5 least busiest station types is 500 rentals to 1; the total number of rentals in this investigation is 168,373. Males outnumber females and gender other by 3 to 1, both station types. Subscribers outnumber customers by 8 to 1, busy stations; the ratio is 3 to 1 for least busiest.
</p>
<p>
The investigations show younger, male, subscribers to the system were the majority of renters at both busiest and least busiest start stations. 
  Since males outnumber females and other genders by 3 to 1 for both station types, finding they were the majority gender is not surprising. Even so, it is confirmed that the majority of male renters were subscribers and tended to be in their low to mid 30's, with median ages of 35 (busiest) and 30 (least busiest).
</p>
<p>
At the 5 busiest start stations weekdays were clearly the heaviest rental days suggesting that renters used the GoBikes to get back and forth to work. This was not so
   for the least busiest start stations where there were no compelling patterns of rentals. Since the location of the stations was not included in the investigations it can only be supposed that the least busiest stations are not within bike riding distance of work places and recreation is the main rental driver.
</p>
<p>
Even though Monday typically starts the work week rentals were somewhat lower than Tuesdays through Fridays at the busiest stations. The least busiest stations showed no patterns for daily usage.
  </p>
  <p>
Some rental characteristics greatly differed for the busiest and least busiest start stations. Markedly, least busy had pattern-less activity across days and wider distribution of ages with minor peaks primarily seen for male renters. Similarities were few: majority of renters were male subscribers in their low to mid 30's.
 </p>
 <p>   
Lastly, the findings indicate the profile of a typical busiest start station rental is a
male subscriber with a median age of 35 who makes weekday rentals.
The profile of a typical least busiest start station rental is a male subscriber with a median age of 30 who does not have a daily pattern of rentals.

## Key Insights for Presentation

The exploration of data point to specific characteristics of renters at the 5 busiest start stations. The typical profile is a male subscriber, age 30 to 35, who rents bikes on weekdays. <br><br>The list of characteristics:
- gender: Male  
- age: low to mid thirties 
- user status: subsciber
- rental day(s): weekdays
